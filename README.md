#  🥒 Rotten Cucumbers - The movie database

##  📓 Introduction

A company in the audiovisual sector has asked us for a web application that will allow their employees to quickly find movies from a large database they have, since the process is currently done manually.

You will be in charge of setting up the core of the application: all the logic of filtering and sorting of movies. You have 2 weeks to finish, which is how long this sprint lasts.

<br>

##  ✅ Goals

- Create a web application that allows users to search for movies.

- Separate the logic from the DOM manipulation and modularize the code.

- Write tests for the functions you create.

- The tests must be written using Jest.

- All the tests must pass.
